<h3>FOREWORD</h3>
<div class="cpoem">
<p><br /><br />
Dear Parents:&mdash;Don't imagine, please,<br />
It's in a boastful spirit<br />
I fashion verses such as these;<br />
That's not the truth or near it.<br />
<br />
A hundred or a thousand, yes,<br />
A million kids there may be<br />
Who aren't one iota less<br />
Attractive than this baby.<br />
<br />
I'll venture that your household has<br />
As valuable a treasure<br />
As mine, but mine I know, and as<br />
For yours, I've not that pleasure.<br />
<br />
And that is why my book's about<br />
Just one, O Dads and Mothers;<br />
But babes are babes, and mine, no doubt,<br />
Is very much like others.<br />

Dollar Bill, that I've held so tight<br />
Ever since payday, a week ago,<br />
Shall I purchase with you tonight<br />
A pair of seats at the vaudeville show?<br />
(Hark! A voice from the easy chair:<br />
"Look at his shoes! We must buy a pair.")<br />
<br />
Dollar Bill, from the wreckage saved,<br />
Tell me, how shall I squander you?<br />
Shall I be shined, shampooed and shaved,<br />
Singed and trimmed 'round the edges, too?<br />
(Hark! A voice from the easy chair:<br />
"He hasn't a romper that's fit to wear.")<br />
<br />
Dollar Bill, that I cherished so,<br />
Think of the cigarettes you'd buy,<br />
Turkish ones, with a kick, you know;<br />
Makin's eventually tire a guy.<br />
(Hark! A voice from the easy chair:<br />
"Look at those stockings! Just one big tear!")<br />
<br />
Dollar Bill, it is time to part.<br />
What do I care for a vaudeville show?<br />
I'll shave myself and look just as smart.<br />

Dollar Bill, we must say good-by;<br />
There on the floor is the Reason Why.<br />

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
There's been a young stranger at our house,<br />
A baby whom nobody knew;<br />
Who hated his brother, his father, his mother,<br />
And made them aware of it, too.<br />
<br />
He stayed with us nearly a fortnight<br />
And carried a grouch all the while,<br />
Nor promise nor present could make him look pleasant;<br />
He hadn't the power to smile.<br />
<br />
He cried when he couldn't have something;<br />
He cried just as hard when he could;<br />
Kind words by the earful but made him more tearful,<br />
And scoldings did just as much good.<br />
<br />
He stormed when his meals weren't ready,<br />
And when they <i>were</i> ready, he screamed.<br />
He went to bed growling, got up again howling<br />
And quarreled and snarled as he dreamed.<br />
<br />
He's gone, and the child we are fond of<br />
Is back, just as nice as of old.<br />
But I hope to be in some port European<br />
The next time he has a bad cold.<br />

My son, I wish that it were half<br />
As easy to extract a laugh<br />
From grown-ups as from thee.<br />
Then I'd go on the stage, my boy,<br />
While Richard Carle and Eddie Foy<br />
Burned up with jealousy.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't have to rack my brain<br />
Or lie awake all night in vain<br />
Pursuit of brand new jokes;<br />
Nor fear my lines were heard with groans<br />
Of pain and sympathetic moans<br />
From sympathetic folks.<br />
<br />
I'd merely have to make a face,<br />
Just twist a feature out of place,<br />
And be the soul of wit;<br />
Or bark, and then pretend to bite,<br />
And, from the screams of wild delight,<br />
Be sure I'd made a hit.<br />

He couldn't have a doughnut, and it made him very mad;<br />
He undertook to get revenge by screaming at his dad.<br />
<br />
"Cut out that noise!" I ordered, and he gave another roar,<br />
And so I put him in "the room" and shut and locked the door.<br />
<br />
I left him in his prison cell two minutes, just about,<br />
And, penitent, he smiled at me when I did let him out.<br />
<br />
But when he got another look at the forbidden fruit<br />
He gave a yell that they could hear in Jacksonville or Butte.<br />
<br />
"Cut out that noise!" I barked again. "Cut out that foghorn stuff!<br />
Perhaps I didn't leave you in your prison long enough.<br />
<br />
"You want your dad to keep you jailed all afternoon, I guess."<br />
He smiled at me and answered his equivalent for "yes."<br />

To be informed I look like you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Would never make me mad.</span><br />
But one thing I am sure of, son,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You have a different line</span><br />
Of humor, your idea of fun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is not a bit like mine.</span><br />
<br />
You drop my slippers in the sink<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And leave them there to soak.</span><br />
That's very laughable, you think<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But I can't see the joke</span><br />
You take my hat outdoors with you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And fill it full of earth;</span><br />
You seem to think that's witty, too,<br />

Since he began to talk and sing,<br />
I've learned one interesting thing&mdash;<br />
The value of a verb is small;<br />
In fact, it has no worth at all.<br />
<br />
Why waste the breath required to say,<br />
"While toddling through the park today,<br />
I saw a bird up in a tree,"<br />
When "Twee, pahk, birt," does splendidly?<br />
<br />
Why should one say, "Please pass the bread,"<br />
When "Ba-ba me" is easier said?<br />
And why "I'm starved. Have supper quick,"<br />
When "LUNCH!" yelled loudly, does the trick?<br />
<br />
Why "I've been riding on a train,"<br />
When "By-by, Choo-choo" makes it plain?<br />
"Let words be few," the poet saith,<br />
So leave out words and save your breath.<br />

I've orders to waken you from your nap,<br />
And orders are orders, my little chap.<br />
But I hate to do it, because it seems<br />
A shame to break in on your blissful dreams.<br />
<br />
I've sat and watched you a long, long while,<br />
And not since I came have you ceased to smile.<br />
So it strikes me as wrong to arouse you, boy,<br />
From sleep that's so plainly a sleep of joy.<br />
<br />
'Twill make a big diff'rence tonight, of course,<br />
But p'rhaps you are riding a real live horse;<br />
In dreams, it's a pleasant and harmless sport,<br />
So why should I cruelly cut it short?<br />

Maybe you have for your very own<br />
A piece of pie or an ice cream cone;<br />
If that's your amusement, why end it quick?<br />
Dream-food can't possibly make you sick.<br />

Orders are orders and I'm afraid<br />

A pote, a mintie, a button hook,<br />
A bag of tobacco, a piece of string,<br />
A pair of wubbas, a bodkin ring,<br />
A deck of twos and a paper box,<br />
A brush, a comb and a lot of blocks&mdash;<br />
When I first gaze on his wonderful trains,<br />
Which he daily builds with infinite pains,<br />
I laugh, and I think to myself, "O gee!<br />
Was ever a child as cute as he?"<br />
<br />
But when he's gone to his cozy nest,<br />
From the toil of his strenuous day to rest,<br />
And when I gaze on his trains once more,<br />
Where they lie, abandoned, across the floor,<br />
And when the terrible task I face<br />
Of putting each "Pullman" back in its place,<br />
I groan a little, and think, "O gee!<br />
Was ever a child as mean as he?"<br />

Why do you love your Cousin Paull?<br />
For his sweet face, his smile, and all<br />
The little tricks that charm us so?<br />
You're not quite old enough to know<br />
How cute he is; to realize<br />
How clever for a child his size.<br />
I'm sure you can't appreciate<br />
The things that make us think him great.<br />
<br />
And yet you love your Cousin Paull.<br />
Is it because he's twice as small<br />
As you, just right for you to maul?<br />
Because he won't fight back, or bawl?<br />
Because when he is pushed he'll fall?<br />
And, where most kids would howl and squall,<br />
He takes it, nor puts in a call<br />
For mother? Am I warm at all?<br />
Is this why you love Cousin Paull?<br />

My baby has a garden,<br />
"Planted" four days ago,<br />
And nearly half his waking hours<br />
He spends among his precious flowers<br />
With sprinkling can and hoe.<br />

My baby has a garden,<br />
And Oh, how proud he is<br />
When, yielding to his pleading, we<br />
Lay work aside and go to see<br />
This masterpiece of his!<br />

Behold my baby's garden,<br />
Close by a rubbish pile!<br />
Look at the sprinkling can and hoe<br />
And flowers; then tell me if you know<br />
Whether to sigh or smile.<br />
<br />
The flowers in baby's garden,<br />
Flat on the ground they lie,<br />
Two hyacinths, a withered pair,<br />
Plucked from the pile of rubbish, where<br />
They had been left to die.<br />
<br />
The flowers in baby's garden,<br />
"Planted" four days ago,<br />
Grow every hour a sadder sight,<br />
Weaker and sicklier, in spite<br />
Of sprinkling can and hoe.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To get what I sought, in the Christmas rush;</span><br />
When they stood on my toes in the crowded train,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or dented my ribs in the sidewalk crush,</span><br />
I dropped my manners and snarled and swore,<br />
And thought: "It's a bothersome, beastly bore!"<br />

But when, at the Christmas dawn, they brought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My kid to the room where his things were piled,</span><br />
And when, from my vantage point, I caught<br />

And the people shook when they heard his name.<br />
He boasted: "I'm one that they'll never get."<br />
But he jollied himself into Joliet.<br />
<br />
Well, son, I suppose you would be admired<br />
For the valorous habit that you've acquired<br />
Of rushing at each little girl you meet<br />
And hugging her tight in the public street.<br />
But the day will come, I have not a doubt,<br />
When you'll stagger home with an eye scratched out.<br />

<p><br />
I wonder what your thought will be<br />
And what you'll say and do, sir,<br />
When you come home again and see<br />
What Daddy's got for you, sir.<br />
<br />
I wonder if you'll like it, boy,<br />
Or turn away disgusted<br />
(You've often scorned a nice, new toy<br />
For one that's old and busted.)<br />
<br />
I wonder if you'll laugh, or cry<br />
And run in fright to mother,<br />
Or just act bored to death, when I<br />
Show you your brand new brother.<br />
